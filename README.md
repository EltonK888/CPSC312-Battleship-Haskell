# CPSC312 Battleship Haskell 2021

## Two Player Mode
This branch is the two player mode for our Battleship project implemented in Haskell.

This mode also features a GUI which was built using the Gloss library.

To run the project, first install the Gloss library.
```
$ cabal install Gloss
```


Then run the project.
```
$ cabal run
```

After running, set up the ships in the terminal and click on any of the squares on the grid to guess your opponents ship locations.
